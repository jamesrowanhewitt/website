        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>These colours have been simulated against every form of colour blindness and are systematically concluded to be accessible.</p>
        <h2>How to use these colours</h2>
        <p>It is good practice to use #011627 as the primary border colour and to add depth to the page.<p>
        <p>#fdffc is simply a off white used as whitespace on the page.</p>
        <p>#f6c461 highlights beautifully with the primary colour and is a great secondary colour.</p>
        <p>#54cec3 and #e71d36 are compliment colours and can be used alongside the other colours when necessary or if applicable.</p>
