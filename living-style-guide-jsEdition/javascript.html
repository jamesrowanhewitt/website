            <h2>Javascript form validation</h2>
             <p>Form validation is extremely important in webdesign, bad form validation is a security threat to the website -as users can access a submission page without following the criteria first.</p>
             <p>The criteria for a valid entry can be different as there are various factors that could come into play: for an example a bank would have strong passsword validation to ensure users have secure passwords with enough length.</p>
             <p>Anonymous-based websites like reddit would have less strict validations rules, any email address can be typed, usernames and password would have no minimum characters or a need for numericals and symbols. Circumstances are different.</p>
             <p>This style guide will validate for matching passwords, blank fields and if the symbols "@" and "." are used in the email field. If the form doesn't meet these requirements return false.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
              <h2>Event listening</h2>
              <p>Event listening is how javascript determines interaction. Once interaction is made the event listener tells javascript to run a specific function.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>onload //when the page loads</li>
                <li>onclick //when a user clicks something</li>
                <li>onmouseover //when a user mouses over something</li>
                <li>onfocus //when a user puts the cursor in a form field</li>
                <li>onblur //When a user leaves a form field</li>
